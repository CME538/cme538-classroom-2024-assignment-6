    "In today’s connected world, where Zoom calls and online collaboration platforms dominate, government officials still seem to have a love for travel. Why spend thousands on trips when technology allows us to have a meeting without ever leaving our desks? It turns out, travel is sometimes unavoidable—whether for meeting key stakeholders, building international relations, or attending summits. However, with taxpayer money at stake, it's important to examine the costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook dives deep into the data of Canadian government travel expenses, based on the Proactive Disclosure - Travel Expenses dataset (see [here](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/009f9a49-c2d9-4d29-a6d4-1a228da335ce/resource/8282db2a-878f-475c-af10-ad56aa8fa72c)).\n",

    "As part of CME538's focus on data science, Lecture 3.3 covered a range of important data cleaning techniques. Here's a summary of what was discussed in the lecture and what you'll see applied in this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Type Conversion**: Converting data types to ensure they match the values they represent.\n",
    "- **Duplicates**: Removing any repeated entries.\n",
    "- **Missing Data**: Handling gaps in the dataset through removal or imputation.\n",
    "- **Implausible Data**: Flagging values that seem incorrect or out of bounds.\n",
    "- **Irrelevant Data**: Removing unnecessary columns to streamline our dataset.\n",
    "- **Character Encoding**: Fixing encoding issues.\n",
    "- **Datetime Parsing**: Ensuring dates are formatted consistently.\n",
    "- **Outliers**: Identifying and potentially removing extreme values.\n",
    "- **Inconsistent Data Entry**: Standardizing any inconsistent input formats (e.g., addresses).\n",
    "- **Unit Conversion**: Standardizing any discrepancies between units (like miles vs kilometers).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will walk through these concepts step by step as we clean and analyze Canada's government travel expense data. Get ready for a mix of interesting insights, and maybe a surprise or two about how tax dollars are being spent!"
