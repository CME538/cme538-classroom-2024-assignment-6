    "## Setup Notebook\n",
    "At the start of a notebook, we need to import the Python packages we plan to use.\n",
    "* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) - A library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. NumPy was introcuded in Lecture 4 and we will learn more about its functionality in this lecture. It is customary to `import numpy as np`.\n",
    "* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language. Lecture 5 and 6 will do a deep dive into the core functionality of Pandas. It is customary to `import pandas as pd`. \n",
    "* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) - Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. We will use Seaborn throughout CIV1498 for data visualization. It is customary to `import seaborn as sns`.  \n",
    "* [Maplotlib](https://matplotlib.org//) - Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. We will use Matplotlib throughout CIV1498 for data visualization. It is customary to `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we want to configure the Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "* `%matplotlib inline` - This code configured the notebook to display all plots, from Seaborn or Matplotlib, in the Notebook as opposed to in a separate pop-up window.\n",
    "* `plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')` - This code configured the plots with the \"fivethirtyeight\" styling, which tries to replicate the styles from the website [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/).\n",
    "* `sns.set_context(\"notebook\")` - This sets the plotting context parameters to be optimized for a Notebook. This affects things like the size of the labels, lines, and other elements of the plot, but not the overall style."
